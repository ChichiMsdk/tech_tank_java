# Assessment for TechTank Deloitte
## My very first program in java
Great pleasure to discover Java for the first time and to build a funny project where I tried to push the limits of what I could
learn within a couple days.<br> 
It represented my very first **true** steps in the world of OOP requiring significant (but so refreshing) shift in my way of thinking, from the procedural and imperative style of C I was used to.
## Project 
Write a java program that reads an **AddressBook** file and answer the following questions:
- [x] How many males are in the address book?
- [x] Who is the oldest person in the address book?
- [x] How many days older is Bill than Paul?
> **Added** the possibility to specify the names we want as arguments of the program
> <br>**Provided** 2 other files in /txt_files to further test the program
## Approach
I tried to comply with the best coding practices found on this [link](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf) form oracle's website.
<br>As I was new to the concept of **test coverage** and the JUnit framework, the tests included may not cover all aspects but should provide a basic demonstration of the functionality.
<br>Made my first debut with JavaDoc to comment efficiently and get to learn how to better organize my codebase
## Feedback and suggestions
Hoping everything needed is there! I had a lot of fun during this enriching experience. I look forward to any feedback or suggestions as improvements must be made!
